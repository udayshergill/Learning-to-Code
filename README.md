# Learning-to-Code
Hi I am Uday Shergill and learning how to code in Python and C++. I am experinced in hardware things like circuit buliding, computer assembling, 3-D printing, laser cutting and many more engineering based things. Now I am expanding to learn coding and become more versatile.

My goals are to use my diverse skillset to improve soceity in any way I can. From designing possible solutions to issues that are affecting my community to collabarating with others in big events, I want to show my impact to the world.
